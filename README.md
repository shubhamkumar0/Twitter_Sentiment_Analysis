This is a submission for the Recommender challenge by @Sirajology on Youtube.
This is the code for the Twitter Sentiment Analyzer

The code uses the tweepy library to access the Twitter API and the TextBlob library to perform Sentiment Analysis on each Tweet. We'll be able to see how positive or negative each tweet is about whatever topic we choose.

##Dependencies

    tweepy (http://www.tweepy.org/)
    textblob (https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)

Install missing dependencies using pip

##Usage

  python demo.py
